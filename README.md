This repo is meant to be a companion for the Fordham University class CISC 2350 Information & Web Programming. It will be the main source for all assignments, lecture notes, projects, and general class materials.  To get started, please read the helpful references below and set up your personal `assignments` repositories.

## <a name="assignments"></a>Assignment Prompts and submissions
All assignment prompts can be found in this repo's [`assignments` directory](assignments).  Each assignment is labeled with the prompt number or project name, and contains a `README.md` file with the details for that week's assignment.

To submit assignments, [follow the step-by-step instructions](notes/lecture5/1-AssignmentRepo.md) on setting up your own personal assignments repository (locally and on GitHub).  The guide focuses on how to create a local and remote version of your assignments repository, as well as the appropriate assignment submission format.

## <a name="notes"></a>Lecture notes
Lecture notes for each week can be found in the [`notes`](notes) directory of the repository.  Each week contains the topics and materials covered, as well as the accompanying resources that go along with them.

## <a name="code"></a>In-class code samples
There will often be live coding samples demonstrated during our scheduled class time.  These samples can be found in the [`samples`](samples) directory.  The samples are organized by lecture and class section.

- Section `c01` is the Wednesday night Lincoln Center class.
- Section `e01` is the Monday night Rose Hill class.

So, the code samples for the Lincoln Center, lecture1 session can be found in the `samples/lecture1/c01` directory.
